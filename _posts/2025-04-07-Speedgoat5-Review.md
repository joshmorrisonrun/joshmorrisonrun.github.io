I purchased two pairs of Hoka Speedgoat 5 (one in January 2023 and another in January 2025), putting around 2000km on them. My longest run in these shoes was 77km. The only other trail running shoes I’ve used extensively are the Hoka Challenger 7, so I’ll be drawing comparisons based on my experience.

# Weight & Performance
The Speedgoat 5 excels at longer distances, when compared to the Hoka Challenger.
On marathon distances and beyond, I found that **my feet hurt more in the Challenger 7s**, whereas in the Speedgoat 5s, my **legs felt more fatigued**. This is likely due to the **extra weight** of the Speedgoat 5, which can add strain to leg muscles over time.

# Comfort
The **Speedgoat 5 is a very comfortable shoe**, with a **high stack height** that absorbs impact well. Despite this, I personally **find the Challenger 7 more comfortable** overall. The stack height is generous, but not overly generous where there is a risk of rolling an ankle.

# Durability Issues
One recurring issue I’ve had is with the **mesh upper**—it started **ripping around 500 km** on both pairs of Speedgoat 5s. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but it’s something to keep in mind if durability is a concern.

# Final Thoughts
The **Hoka Speedgoat 5 is an excellent choice for long-distance trail running**, providing strong cushioning and durability. While I prefer the **Hoka Challenger 7 for comfort**, the Speedgoat 5 performs better over extended distances. The only real downside I’ve encountered is the **mesh tearing**, which happened earlier than I expected.
